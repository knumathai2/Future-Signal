# Project: Outlook Signals

_Last updated: 2026-07-08_

## Summary

Outlook Signals is an information-analysis dashboard that surfaces global issues whose reflected expectation value has recently shifted significantly in Polymarket's public prediction-market data. It helps users understand how an issue is being reassessed through change magnitude, time-series charts, and interpretation-caution notices — explicitly **not** a forecasting, betting, or trading tool.

Built as a **5-day hackathon MVP by a 4-person team**.

## Current State

- **Version**: v0.3.0-day2-closed
- **Phase**: Day 2 closed; Day 3 ready
- **Next milestone**: Day 3 — detail screen, chart/tooltip refinement, inflection-point markers, and interpretation-caution text
- **Overall health**: 🟢 Good — the Day 2 data/API/dashboard path is merged, verified, and still within the narrowed MVP scope

## Tech Summary

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Language | TypeScript (frontend) + Python (backend/data/AI) |
| Framework | React + Vite + Tailwind + Recharts (frontend) / FastAPI (backend) |
| Infrastructure | Vercel + Railway/Render + Supabase/Neon |
| Repo Structure | Single monorepo (`/frontend`, `/backend`) |

## Implementation Snapshot

| Area | Current state |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Dashboard v1 is integrated with backend routes and static fallback, including ranked issue cards, category/window/sort controls, detail view, Recharts line chart, error fallback states, data-as-of timestamps, caution badges, and review-hardened insufficient-data display for missing change references. |
| Backend | FastAPI app, `/api/health`, accepted `/api/issues`/detail/history/report/category contract, Pydantic schemas, and contract tests exist. `TASK-010` merged live issue list/detail/history read paths with documented static fallback behavior. Schema draft is accepted but unapplied. |
| Data/AI | `TASK-007` produced 50 normalized records and structured skip details; `TASK-008` computes 24h/7d metrics through a local/dev-safe path; `TASK-009` inserts MVP expectation-shift detector rows from the ±5pp threshold. |
| PM / Safety | P0 scope remains locked; wording policy references `standards.md` and `memory/glossary.md`; Day 2 closeout is recorded in `reports/day-2-closeout-plan.md`, and Day 3 can begin from the verified data/API/dashboard baseline. |

## Constraints

- 5-day build window, 4-person team — see `../ORCHESTRATOR.md` and `../roadmap.md` for day-by-day allocation
- No accounts/login/saving/notifications/reports/team-sharing in MVP (PRD §6.5)
- No free-form AI analysis, no automated news matching, no wallet-level participant features (see `AGENTS.md` Absolute Restrictions)
- Every data-bearing screen requires a data-as-of timestamp + interpretation-caution badge (PRD §8.10)
- Strict prohibited-wording policy — see `glossary.md` and `../standards.md`
