# Project: Outlook Signals

_Last updated: 2026-07-07_

## Summary

Outlook Signals is an information-analysis dashboard that surfaces global issues whose reflected expectation value has recently shifted significantly in Polymarket's public prediction-market data. It helps users understand how an issue is being reassessed through change magnitude, time-series charts, and interpretation-caution notices — explicitly **not** a forecasting, betting, or trading tool.

Built as a **5-day hackathon MVP by a 4-person team**.

## Current State

- **Version**: v0.1.0-dev (pre-Day-1)
- **Phase**: Harness + planning docs complete (PRD, Service Design, Technical Design, UX Design) — implementation not yet started
- **Next milestone**: Day 1 — finalize scope, validate Polymarket data, screen skeleton (see `../roadmap.md`)
- **Overall health**: 🟢 Good — scope is well-defined and narrowed per PRD v1.1 rescoping

## Tech Summary

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Language | TypeScript (frontend) + Python (backend/data/AI) |
| Framework | React + Vite + Tailwind + Recharts (frontend) / FastAPI (backend) |
| Infrastructure | Vercel + Railway/Render + Supabase/Neon |
| Repo Structure | Single monorepo (`/frontend`, `/backend`) |

## Constraints

- 5-day build window, 4-person team — see `../ORCHESTRATOR.md` and `../roadmap.md` for day-by-day allocation
- No accounts/login/saving/notifications/reports/team-sharing in MVP (PRD §6.5)
- No free-form AI analysis, no automated news matching, no wallet-level participant features (see `AGENTS.md` Absolute Restrictions)
- Every data-bearing screen requires a data-as-of timestamp + interpretation-caution badge (PRD §8.10)
- Strict prohibited-wording policy — see `glossary.md` and `../standards.md`
